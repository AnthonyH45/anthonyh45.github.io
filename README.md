# Welcome to my website

This will serve as a testing ground for my HTML & CSS, as well as a public facing site with all my links.

There is a CTF on my website that is hopefully doable, if you get stuck or are having trouble, please let me know as I wanted it to be fun and not mind-bendingly difficult.

## Links

## NOTE

- The animated favicon only works in firefox right now, so use that if you wanna see the little golang gopher dance. It was a slack emote found from online.

## NOTE 2.0

- Only 5 people have solved my CTF so far, can you figure it out?
