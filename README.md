Welcome to my website!
This will serve as a testing ground for my HTML & CSS, as well as a public facing site with all my links for resume purposes.
There is a CTF on my website that is hopefully doable, if you get stuck or are having trouble, please let me know as I wanted it to be fun and not mind-bendingly difficult.

# Links
Here are the links from the website:

# [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://anthonyh45.github.io/react-gh-pages/)
I followed the React tutorial on building a tic-tac-toe game ([link](https://anthonyh45.github.io/react-gh-pages/)), added highlighting squares, changed some css and published it using `gh-pages`, again, following a tutorial on how to publish React apps on github ([here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages))

# NOTE
- The animated favicon only works in firefox right now, so use that if you wanna see the little golang gopher dance. It was a slack emote found from online.

# NOTE 2.0
- Only 3 people have solved my CTF so far, can you figure it out?
