Welcome to my website!
This will serve as a testing ground for my HTML & CSS, as well as a public facing site with all my links for resume purposes.
There is a CTF on my website that is hopefully doable, if you get stuck or are having trouble, please let me know as I wanted it to be fun and not mind-bendingly difficult.
