    <p class="text_body" style="color:#00ff00"> 
        Hello and welcome! My name is Anthony (as it says on top) and I am a second year student at UCR right now. Welcome to my home page! Please feel free to look around. 
    </p>

    <p class="text_body" style="color:#00ff00">
        I currently work as a Campus Tour Guide because I loved my first year so much I had to tell everyone how great it was! I am currently studying Computer Science with Business Applications as I will apply the Computer Science problem solving mindset to the business realm. Mainly, I am looking into Security type positions, but am also interested in Software Engineering and logistics.
    </p>

    <p class="text_body">
        I am the President of Cyber@UCR, UCR's one stop shop for everything security related. From physical security (lockpicking & getting out of hancuffs) to cyber security (defense and attack of networks). Currently, we are involved with two competitions, the defense one being the Western Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (WRCCDC) and the Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC). This is going to be our first year competing in CPTC so let's rock!<br>If you would like to know more, please click on the links below!

        <b> Workshops : </b>
            My workshops are meant to be interactive rather than a lecture, first 20 minutes is usually information, while the rest is a live demo and hands on approach where I call people up and ask them questions. You learn by doing, and that's why the slides are not meant to be an hour long content show, instead it's supposed to make people feel comfortable with getting started. 
            <!-- <br> 
            For the Linux workshop, I go over what Bash is, what a kernel is, and some common use cases of the most known commands. 
            <br>
            The lockpicking one is our crowd favorite as we bring a plethora of locks and picks (as well as handcuffs) and have people try it themselves. 
            <br>
            The `Introduction to CTFs` is meant to introduce our club members to the competitions we will be doing as well as clarify some mumbo jumbo that often confuses beginners. 
            <br> -->
            <br>

            I also did a walkthrough of `easy_reverse` by `cbm_hackers` on crackmes.one for the Introduction to CTFs but did not include it because it is meant to be an interactive walkthrough rather than a writeup.
